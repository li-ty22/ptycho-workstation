# ptycho-workstation
This repository provides an open-source implementation of a batched stochastic gradient descent algorithm for 2D ptychographic reconstruction. The code is part of a custom MATLAB pipeline designed to efficiently process large 4D-STEM/ptychographic datasets using GPU-accelerated computation.
